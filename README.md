### 1) Viola-Jones Algorithm
  - Learn what it is, how it was created, and how it is still to this such a powerful algorithm despite it being created more than ten years ago.

### 2) Haar-Like Features
  - Foundation of Viola-Jones Algorithm which is actually used in open city. 

### 3) Integral Image 
  - Hack used in the Viola-Jones Algorithm, part of the success of the algorithm can be attributed to this integral image. 

### 4) Training Classifiers
  - How the training process actually happens. 
  
### 5) Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost)
  - Another hack used to help the viola-jones algorithm in its success
  
### 6) Cascading
  - Another hack to really speed up the viola-jones algorithm, OpenCV
